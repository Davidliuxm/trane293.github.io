abstract = "Breast cancer has been the second leading cause of death among women after lung cancer according to the American Cancer Society. Early detection of breast cancer is critical and can reduce the mortality rate by a large margin. Computer Aided Diagnosis System (CADx) have shown to help radiologists in effectively identifying abnormalities and correctly classify them as benign or malignant. In this paper, we propose a system for the classification of mammographic masses as benign or malignant. Through this study our contribution is two fold; we investigate the use of true TRS invariant Zernike Moments as global shape descriptors, which to our knowledge has not been applied to mammographic mass classification task. Second, we propose a wrapper based feature selection scheme based upon an evolutionary algorithm and a novel set of 3 objective functions to minimize. The underlying algorithm in our feature selection method is a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) which minimizes our given set of 3 objective functions. Through experiments we show that our proposed set of 3 objective functions when minimized simultaneously, allows the NSGA-II to evolve a Pareto front of optimal solutions which reduce the original feature dimensionality by 98.71% (from 312 to 6), while significantly outperforming  lassifiers trained on features with high dimensionality. We report our results on 2 classifiers; Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and using 270 images from the DDSM Database."

abstract_short = "We proposed a novel feature selection technique based upon Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGAII) and a combination of three objective functions. The project has been undergoing since 2 years under the guidance of Dr. Jayasree Chakraborty and Dr. Abhishek Midya (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA), with me working remotely. We show that our proposed method can reduce dimensionality by almost 98%, while performing better than the case where we use all features instead of only selected features."
