abstract_short = "This project was started as my bachelors dissertation project at ISI-Cal under Prof. Sushmita Mitra and Dr. B. Uma Shankar. We proposed a novel, fast and accurate Computer Aided Detection (CADe) system for Gliomas (tumors) in Brain MRI capable of approximately detecting tumorous regions in brain MRI slices. The CADe system is based upon two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) architectures that work in two phases: first, to figure out whether a patient study is abnormal or not, and second, if the patient study is abnormal, to find out bounding boxes in each MRI slice delineating the tumor region from normal tissue. We show that our method when used as a preliminary step before exact tumor segmentation yields much better results as compared to segmenting tumor region without prior approximate knwoledge of tumor location."
