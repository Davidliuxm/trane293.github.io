# Biography

I am a curious fellow fascinated by the booming research in artificial intelligence and its prospects in health industry, particularly medical imaging. I have had the privilege of working on exciting research problems since my freshman year at DAVIET. I started off with Image Processing, but found my calling in Medical Image Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Much of my work has centered around applying machine learning methods towards automatic diagnosis of cancerous tumors in medical images like mammograms and brain MRI scans. I been honed in research by Dr. Jayasree Chakraborty and Dr. Abhishek Midya (currently at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York) since my freshman year. I was tremendously nourished in research by Prof. Sushmita Mitra and Dr. B. Uma Shankar at Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata (ISI-Cal) where I did my bachelors dissertation. 

Currently I am working as Machine Learning Engineer at RadSupport, Inc., based out of Mountain View, California, USA, designing a new product that utilizes proprietary medical imaging data to diagnose abnormalities using deep learning techniques. 

Apart from research, I love nature, working out, hanging out with friends and learning about exciting new advances in my field. I absolutely love reading technology magazines, and my favorite has always been Digit. I am an avid gamer having spent almost close to a decade playing first-person-shooters like Counter Strike and Battlefield series.
